The goal of this tutorial (given at the `2013 summer school on quantum
spin liquids <http://www.democritos.it/qsl2013/>`_, in Trieste, Italy)
is to present the `density-matrix renormalization group
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group>`_
(DMRG) in its traditional formulation (i.e. without using matrix
product states).  DMRG is a numerical method that allows for the
efficient simulation of quantum model Hamiltonians.  Since it is a
low-entanglement approximation, it often works quite well for
one-dimensional systems, giving results that are nearly exact.
