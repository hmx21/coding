Additional information on DMRG
==============================

Below is an incomplete list of resources for learning DMRG.

- "`An introduction to numerical methods in low-dimensional quantum
  systems <http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0304375>`_"
  by A. L. Malvezzi (2003) teaches DMRG concisely but in enough detail
  to understand the ``simple-dmrg`` code.

- U. Schollwöck has written two review articles on DMRG.  `The first
  (from 2005) <http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0409292>`_ focuses on
  DMRG in its traditional formulation, while `the second (from 2011)
  <http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3477>`_ describes it in terms of matrix
  product states.

- Steve White's papers, including the `original DMRG paper (1992)
  <http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v69/i19/p2863_1>`_, `a more
  in-depth paper (1993)
  <http://prb.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v48/i14/p10345_1>`_ which includes
  (among other things) periodic boundary conditions, and a `later
  paper (1996) <http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9604129>`_ which
  describes eigenstate prediction, are quite useful.
